# BLIND-SPOT-DETECTION
The project is related toward's blind spot detection using image processing.

The project is built using method of image processing, deep learning and embedded system.

In this project the Hardware componenet used are:
    -> esp32cam,
    -> OLED display,
    -> FTDI module(This module is used for the purpose of connectting the esp32cam with the laptop or pc),
    -> memory card.

The prototype works in given steps ->
    1. The image is taken by the esp32cam,
    2. The image is preprocessed and further transfered for the process of object classification,
    3. The given image data is classified and it's output is displayed on Oled display.
